Tutorial part 3: Optional: Loading your simpack into the GUI
============================================================

In :ref:`part 2 <intro-tutorial2>` of the tutorial, we created our very first
simpack, ``coin_flip``. We played around with the simpack on the Python shell.
In this **optional** tutorial, we will load our simpack into
:mod:`garlicsim_wx`, which is the GarlicSim GUI.

GUI is an abbreviation of `Graphical User Interface`_. What it means is that
it's a program like Word or Photoshop, with windows, menus, buttons and other
graphical widgets. This is what it looks like on Windows 7:

    :alt: GarlicSim GUI on Windows 7
    
The GarlicSim GUI works on the three major operating systems: Windows XP/7, Mac
OS, and Linux.


.. admonition:: The GUI is optional

    Some people, usually hard-core programmers, don't like GUIs. So please
    note: :mod:`garlicsim_wx`, a.k.a. the GarlicSim GUI, is a **completely
    optional** part of GarlicSim. If you prefer working with :mod:`garlicsim`
    in the shell, you can keep doing that, and you can ``import garlicsim`` in
    your project and use it as a normal Python package without even installing
    :mod:`garlicsim_wx`, which is completely separated from :mod:`garlicsim`.
    
This tutorial assumes that you have :mod:`garlicsim_wx` installed; if you
don't, :ref:`go here <intro-installation-developers-python-2.x>` to install it.

Loading a simpack into :mod:`garlicsim_wx` without any preparations
===================================================================

Launch the GarlicSim GUI::

    c:\> GarlicSim.py
    
If you installed :mod:`garlicsim_wx` properly, the GUI would now open up with
no simulation loaded.

Let's start a new simulation project. Choose :menuselection:`&File --> &New`,
and you'll get this dialog:

.. image:: /images/screenshot_choose_simpack.png
    :align: center
    :alt: GarlicSim GUI showing the "Choose simpack" dialog

(Again, this screenshot is from Windows 7; if you use a different operating
system, the interface will look different for you, but don't worry, it'll
function exactly the same.)

In this dialog the GUI asks us which simpack to use for our new simulation. If
you want to get to know the GarlicSim GUI, you can have a go at one of the
bundled simpacks, especially :mod:`garlicsim_lib.simpacks.life`; you can start
a :mod:`life <garlicsim_lib.simpacks.life>` simulation and try to click all the
different buttons and menus on the screen to figure out what everything does.
Assuming you already did that, let's load our own ``coin_flip`` simpack.

Click the :guilabel:`&Add folder containing simpacks...` button. This will open
a window where you browse around your computer and choose a folder. Choose the
folder that *contains* the ``coin_flip`` folder that we created in :ref:`the
previous tutorial <intro-tutorial2>`\ . (Joining us only now? :download:`Click
here <downloads/coin_flip.zip>` to download the ``coin_flip`` simpack.)

After you did that, a ``coin_flip`` entry will be added to your simpacks list.
Choose it and press :guilabel:`Create &project`. Your new project was created!
You would see something like this:
    
.. image:: /images/screenshot_coin_flip_fresh.png
    :align: center
    :alt: GarlicSim GUI showing a no-frills simpacks

Now, we're not going to explain every widget on the GarlicSim GUI in this
tutorial. But one thing you can notice is the "State Viewer". The State Viewer
displays the current world state. Every simpack displays something different in
the State Viewer; for example, the :mod:`life <garlicsim_lib.simpacks.life>`
simpack displays the Life two-dimensional grid, while a Newtonian Physics
simpack may display a 3D view of bodies colliding.

As you can see in the above screenshot, our ``coin_flip`` simpack displays a
textual representation of the world state. This is why it's called a "State
Repr Viewer". This is a "no-frills" State Viewer that every simpack gets for
free. So if your simpack works with :mod:`garlicsim`, you can load it into the
GUI without programming *anything*, and you'll get a basic, no-frills but
workable view of the world state in your simulation.

Creating dedicated widgets for your simpack
===========================================

Okay, so it's nice to have basic no-frills widgets for our simpack, but we want
more. We want to customize how :mod:`garlicsim_wx` displays our state, so it
will be a pretty graphical display instead of a textual one.

.. admonition:: You need to know wxPython

    In order to code your own customized state viewer, you need to be familiar
    with `wxPython`_. If this is your first time with wxPython, I recommend
    following `Jan Bodnar's wxPython tutorial`_.

Let's look at ``coin_flip``\'s folder structure. Note that there is a
``coin_flip/wx`` subpackage; this is where you put your GUI definitions. Go
into the ``coin_flip/wx/widgets/state_viewer.py`` module. You may read the
helpful comments in that module; and then replace it with the following GUI
code::

    from __future__ import division
    
    import itertools
    
    import wx
    
    import garlicsim_wx
    
    
    class StateViewer(wx.Panel,
                      garlicsim_wx.widgets.WorkspaceWidget):
        # Here you create a widget that will display your state graphically on the
        # screen.
        
        def __init__(self, frame):
                
            # We need to call the __init__ of both our base classes:
            wx.Panel.__init__(self, frame,
                              style=wx.SUNKEN_BORDER)        
            garlicsim_wx.widgets.WorkspaceWidget.__init__(self, frame)
            
            self.SetBackgroundStyle(wx.BG_STYLE_CUSTOM) # Solves Windows flicker
            
            self.state = None
            
            self.Bind(wx.EVT_PAINT, self.on_paint)
            self.Bind(wx.EVT_SIZE, self.on_size)
            
            # ...
            
    
            # This next bit will cause the widget to get updated every time the
            # active state in the GUI is changed:
            self.gui_project.active_node_changed_emitter.add_output(
                lambda: self.set_state(self.gui_project.get_active_state())
            )
    
    
        def set_state(self, state):
            # Here you set the state to be displayed.
            self.state = state
            self.Refresh()
            
            
        def on_paint(self, event):
            # This is your EVT_PAINT handler, which draws the state on the widget.
    
            event.Skip()

Now go to ``coin_flip/wx/settings.py`` to enable this :class:`StateViewer`
class. Ensure that this file starts with the following::

    from .widgets import state_viewer as _
    # from .widgets import state_creation_dialog as _
    from . import widgets
    
    
    ########### *All* of the settings in this module are optional. ################
    
    
    BIG_WORKSPACE_WIDGETS = [widgets.state_viewer.StateViewer]

Okay, we're ready to rock.

Load the simulation again, and now we'll have a nice graphical display:

What's next
===========

This is the end of the tutorial series for now. To learn more about GarlicSim,
read the :ref:`topical guides <topics-index>`. You should also go over all of 
the skeleton files that were created when you executed the
:command:`start_simpack.py` script: There's useful information there about
how to customize different aspects of your simpack.
