Mailing Lists
=============

The main GarlicSim mailing list is at `garlicsim@librelist.org
<mailto:garlicsim@librelist.org>`_. If you need any kind of help, or have
anything to say, say it here. You'll get a quick response.

The development mailing list is `garlicsim.dev@librelist.org
<mailto:garlicsim.dev@librelist.org>`_. This is for the developers who work on
GarlicSim itself.

To subscribe to a list, just send an empty email to it. (This is required before
you can post anything.)

These lists are hosted by `librelist <http://librelist.org>`_, which is
currently slightly experimental.
