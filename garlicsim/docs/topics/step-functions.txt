=============================================
The step function -- The heart of the simpack
=============================================

The step function is the most important part of a simpack. The step function
contains the world laws and tells GarlicSim how to calculate the next world
state in a simulation.

Writing a simple step function is easy and we'll show how to do it below; after
you've mastered that, we'll show you more advanced ways to define and use step
functions. We'll also show you the different kinds of step functions that
GarlicSim allows.

Different kinds of step functions
=================================

Below we will show the different kinds of step functions. Keep in mind that
your step function's type will be determined automatically from its name; for
example, a step function called ``step`` (or ``my_step`` or ``step_alternate``)
will be automatically identified as a simple step function; as another example,
a step function called ``history_step_generator`` (or
``faster_history_step_generator`` or ``my_awesome_history_step_generator``)
will be automatically identified as a history step generator.

If you wish to give a different name to your step function and specify its type
manually, you can do that by decorating the step function with the step type.


.. _simple-step-function:

The simple step function
------------------------

The simple step function is also known as
:class:`garlicsim.misc.simpack_grokker.step_types.SimpleStep`.

Here's an example of a ``State`` class that defines a simple step function
which is only two lines long::

    class State(garlicsim.data_structures.State):
    
        def __init__(self, height):
            self.height = height
            
        def step(self):
            return State(self.height + 1)
        
In this step function we created a new state object, set one of its attributes,
and returned it. This is enough for GarlicSim to use this simpack to generate
states.

Do notice one thing we *didn't* do: We didn't set clock readings to our states.
When you simulate with GarlicSim, every state always gets a ``.clock``
attribute which says its clock reading. The step function usually assigns this
``.clock`` attribute, but when it doesn't, (such as in the example above,)
GarlicSim automatically gives each state a clock reading. Newly-created states
get a clock of 0 by default, and on every step the new state's clock reading
will be higher by 1 than that of the original state.


.. _inplace-step-function:

The inplace step function
-------------------------

The inplace step function is also known as
:class:`garlicsim.misc.simpack_grokker.step_types.InplaceStep`.

If you've written a simpack or two, you may have noticed that you often keep
many attributes on your world states. It can be a drag to recreate all of these
attributes in the step function. If you use an inplace step function, you don't
have to. Example::

    class State(garlicsim.data_structures.State):
    
        def __init__(self, height, weight, spin):
            self.height = height
            self.weight = weight
            self.spin = spin
                        
        def inplace_step(self):
            self.height += 1
            
The inplace step function changes the state in place instead of returning a new
state. An inplace step function doesn't return anything. (i.e., it returns
:data:`None`.) The modified state will still have all of the old attributes it
had. (In this example ``weight`` and ``spin``.)

But wait, you say. How can we modify a state in place? GarlicSim needs to keep
all the states in a time tree as constants, if states will be modified in
place, it will ruin the whole thing!

Well, GarlicSim is smart, and when it uses an inplace step function, it
duplicates the state before feeding it to the step function on every iteration,
so that the original state and all produced states that go to the tree are left
unaltered.

GarlicSim will also advance the new state's clock by one if the inplace step
function didn't advance it itself. This feature is available on all step
function types.

One more advantage that the inplace step has is that if you use
:func:`garlicsim.simulate` with it, the step will actually be done in place for
better performance, without duplicating on every iteration. For example, if you
give :func:`garlicsim.simulate` an initial state and tell it to do 100
iterations, it will first deepcopy your initial state, then perform 100
iterations of the inplace step function *in place*, and then return the
resulting state. This is done only in :func:`garlicsim.simulate`, and not in
:class:`garlicsim.Project`, because :func:`garlicsim.simulate` is the only
function that doesn't reveal the interim states to the user, so we can afford
not to keep them as constants.


.. _step-generator:

The step generator
------------------

The step generator is also known as
:class:`garlicsim.misc.simpack_grokker.step_types.StepGenerator`.

You can write your step as a :py:term:`generator`. Example::

    class State(garlicsim.data_structures.State):
    
        def __init__(self, height):
            self.height = height
            
        def step_generator(self):
            current_state = self
            while True:
                current_state = State(current_state.height + 1)
                yield state
                
Instead of a step function that returns states, we have a generator that keeps
:py:keyword:`yield`\ing states indefinitely.

Some steps are easier to write as a step generator, because every time they yield
a state they remember in which line they paused and what the values of all the
local variables are.


.. _inplace-step-generator:

The inplace step generator
--------------------------

The inplace step generator is also known as
:class:`garlicsim.misc.simpack_grokker.step_types.InplaceStepGenerator`.

The inplace step generator combines the advantages of the inplace step function
with those of the step generator. Example::

    class State(garlicsim.data_structures.State):
    
        def __init__(self, height, weight, spin):
            self.height = height
            self.weight = weight
            self.spin = spin
            
        def inplace_step_generator(self):
            while True:
                self.height += 1
                yield
                
The inplace step generator changes the state in place, and after every
iteration it yields, and after being called again it modifies the state in
place again, ad infinitum.

Note that the inplace step generator doesn't :py:keyword:`yield` any states; it
always yields :data:`None`. It has no need to :py:keyword:`yield` any states,
since it's changing the state itself, not creating any new state objects.

Similarly to the inplace step function, GarlicSim will take care to duplicate
any states before they are being fed into the inplace step generator; this will
be done in :class:`garlicsim.Project`, :func:`garlicsim.list_simulate` and
:func:`garlicsim.iter_simulate`, but not in :func:`garlicsim.simulate` which
will actually perform the state in place to enjoy better performance. (Note
that the initial state *will* be duplicated, but all the simulation iterations
will be done in place on the copy, and then it will be returned as the return
value of :func:`garlicsim.simulate`.)


.. _history-step-function:

The history step function
-------------------------

The history step function is also known as
:class:`garlicsim.misc.simpack_grokker.step_types.HistoryStep`.

The history step function is very different from all the other step functions.
In all the other step functions, it is assumed that all the step function needs
to have is the last world state, and from that it can calculate the new state.
That is true for many kinds of simulations, but not for all. Some simulation
steps need access to the complete history of the simulation in order to
calculate the next state. (This is true, for example, in some simulations of
radiation.)

Here's an example of a history step function::

    class State(garlicsim.data_structures.State):
    
        def __init__(self, height):
            self.height = height
            
        @staticmethod
        def history_step(history_browser):
            last_state = history_browser.get_last_state()
            state_three_seconds_ago = history_browser.get_state_by_clock(
                last_state.clock - 3
            )
            return State(
                height=(state_three_seconds_ago.height + 1)
            )
        
As you can see, the history step function doesn't even receive a state object;
it's a static method.

What the history step function does receive is a history browser, of the class
:class:`BaseHistoryBrowser<garlicsim.misc.base_history_browser.BaseHistoryBrowser>`.
A history browser lets you explore the history of the simulation by retrieving
states from it. For example, the :meth:`.get_state_by_clock
<garlicsim.misc.base_history_browser.BaseHistoryBrowser.get_state_by_clock>`
method shown above gets a state from the timeline according to its clock
reading. You may also request states by index number, like so::

    second_to_last_state = history_browser[-2]
    
A simpack which uses a history step function is also called a
"history-dependent" simpack, and it may not use any non-history-dependent step
functions. Note that you cannot use :class:`ProcessCruncher
<garlicsim.asynchronous_crunching.crunchers.ProcessCruncher>` with
history-dependent simpacks.

        
.. _history-step-generator:

The history step generator
--------------------------

The history step generator is also known as
:class:`garlicsim.misc.simpack_grokker.step_types.HistoryStepGenerator`.

The history step generator combines the advantages of a step generator with the
history-dependent approach.

As of GarlicSim 0.6.3, the history step generator is not yet implemented. Sorry.


Step functions can take arguments
=================================

Step functions always take the world state (or history browser) as a first
argument. But, step functions can also take other optional arguments. For
example::

    class State(garlicsim.data_structures.State):
    
        def __init__(self, height):
            self.height = height
            
        def step(self, time_interval=1):
            new_state = State(self.height + time_interval)
            new_state.clock = self.clock + time_interval
            return new_state
            
In this example we used an argument called ``time_interval``, which determined
how big of a time interval we use between states in the timeline. You can
invent your own step function arguments for all kinds of purposes. A few
examples are: Changing physical constants in a Physics simulation, changing
birth/survival numbers in cellular automata, changing the number of customers
that come to a queue every second in a Queueing Theory simulation, etc.

.. admonition:: Default values for arguments

    Note that if a step function allows arguments, each and every argument
    *must* have a default value. (as in ``t=1``.) This is so the step function
    could always be run with just a state, without requiring the user to figure
    out which arguments the simpack is expecting.
    
To learn how to use step function arguments when running a simulation,
:ref:`check out the article about step profiles <topics-step-profiles>`\.


Defining multiple step functions in the same simpack
====================================================

You can define more than one step function in your simpack. For example::

    class State(garlicsim.data_structures.State):
    
        def __init__(self, height):
            self.height = height
            
        def step(self):
            return State(self.height + 1)
            
        def my_other_step(self):
            new_state = State(self.height + 1)
            return new_state
            
        def inplace_step_generator(self):
            while True:
                self.height += 1
                yield
                
As you can see above, you can have different kinds of step functions in the
same ``State`` class.

This is useful because sometimes you want to implement several simulation
algorithms and to be able to use them all in one simulation time-tree in order
to compare their results side-by-side.

When running the simulation, you can specify which step function you want to
use. For example, when using :func:`garlicsim.simulate`, you may give an
argument ``step_function=my_simpack.State.my_cool_inplace_step`` to make it use
the step function you specify.
