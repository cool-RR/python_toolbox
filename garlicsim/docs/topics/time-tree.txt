=============
The time tree
=============

**Source code**: `garlicsim/data_structures/tree.py`_

:ref:`In the previous chapter <topics-what-is-garlicsim>` we defined the concept
of a state. But in order to do a simulation, we need to put states in context
with each other: We need to define a timeline of states that follow each other
chronologically.

A timeline would be a succession of states that follow each other in time. Every
state in that succession is wrapped in a **node**. Every node has a parent and a
child. If node 1 is the parent of node 2, that means that node 2 follows node 1
immediately in time.

A node is a device for putting a state in chronological context with other
states in the simulation. It is the class :class:`garlicsim.state.Node`. Inside
every node there is a state; it is the attribute ``.state`` of the node.

The very act of computing the simulation, or as we call it, **crunching**, means
to take the most recent node from the timeline, to retrieve its state, to apply
the step function on it, thus receiving a new state, wrapping that in a node and
putting that as the new child of the previous node. This is how the timeline
gets built, and when it is long enough we can observe the phenomenon that we're
interested in simulating.

But actually, we're not going to define a timeline. We're going to define
something better: A **time tree**. This would be represented by the class
:class:`garlicsim.data_structures.Tree`.

It's easy to understand the concept of a timeline: A succession of states that
follow each other in time. A time tree is a generalization of a timeline. A
degenerate time tree is simply a time line. That would be a tree which has no
splits in it, i.e. every node but the last one has exactly one child. But what's
the meaning of a tree which is split into two at some point?

The meaning is that there are two different timelines, two different scenarios
contained within the same tree. The point of the split is also called a
**fork**.

By forking a time tree we can explore different scenarios within the same
project. Before we get into that, we need to note that there are two kinds of
forks: A **natural fork** and a **fork by editing**.


What is a natural fork?
=======================

A natural fork, also called **fork by crunching**, is only relevant in
simulations which have some random non-deterministic factor in their step
function. You can make a natural fork in deterministic simulations as well; but
that would be of little use, because the second timeline will be identical to
the first.

A natural fork simply means that you start crunching the simulation again, from
the point of the fork. In simulations that have some randomness in their step
function, you will probably see a different reality in the new timeline. This is
because whatever random factors were created during the first timeline will
probably get a different random value in the new timeline.

For example, you may have a simulation in which firefighters try to extinguish a
forest fire as fast as possible, while the progress of each of them has some
random factor in it. When you run the simulation the first time, you might see
that they managed to extinguish the fire after it has burned 34 trees. If you
decide to do a natural fork at some point of the simulation, then in this new
timeline they might end up with a different number of burnt trees.


How do I make a natural fork?
-----------------------------

To make a natural fork in your project's tree, call
:meth:`project.begin_crunching(node, clock_buffer) <Project.begin_crunching>`.
``node`` is the node from which you want to fork, and ``clock_buffer`` is the
amount of time you want to have crunched on your new fork. (Of course, you may
crunch it further whenever you want.)

Don't forget to call :meth:`Project.sync_crunchers` twice after this; the first
time is for starting the crunchers, the second time is for collecting the work
from them.


What is a fork by editing?
==========================

A fork by editing is when you have a timeline, and you take one state from it,
create a copy of it which you modify, and then put that modified state in a node
that is parallel to the node of the original state.

For example, let's say we're doing a simulation of two robots combating each
other. We run the simulation and after the battle has finished, one of the
robots won and destroyed the other. We may ask, what would have happened if a
giant boulder would have fallen on the two robots while they were fighting?

.. image:: /images/fork_by_editing.png
    :align: center

The above illustration shows how we will do that. We will take the node in which
robot 2 hits back, and edit it, adding a giant boulder coming from the sky. This
will result in a new and different timeline, in which robot 1 wins the fight.
The node with the edited state is called a **touched node** or an **edited
node**.

GarlicSim provides an automated procedure for creating that fork, so the user
only needs to edit the state and the rest is done for him.


How do I make a fork by editing?
--------------------------------

To make a fork by editing in your project's tree, call
:meth:`project.fork_to_edit(node) <Project.fork_to_edit>`. ``node`` is the node
that you want to duplicate and edit. The method will return the new node. You
may modify the ``.state`` of the new node as you wish, and then call
:meth:`Node.finalize() <Node.finalize>` on it when you're done.
