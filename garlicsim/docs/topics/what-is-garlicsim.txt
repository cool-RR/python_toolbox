What is GarlicSim
=================

In this guide we'll try to explain what GarlicSim is all about. You know that
GarlicSim is a Pythonic framework for simulations, but what does that mean?


What is a simulation exactly?
=============================

Before trying to define what "simulation" means, let's try to think of a few examples of simulations:

* A simulation of a basketball bouncing on the floor.

* A simulation of a car engine, describing the movement of its pistons and the
  flow of fuel in and out of the engine.

* A simulation of an anti-matter particle annihilating with a normal matter
  particle.

* A simulation of the spread of an epidemic in a geographic region.

* A simulation of a population of poker players playing in groups with each
  other.

* A simulation of the evolution of the artificial intelligence of robots that
  live in a simulated physical world and combat with each other for survival.

* A simulation of a computer processor.

* A simulation of cellular automata, such as :ref:`Conway's Game of Life
  <intro-tutorial1>`.

* A simulation of a Turing machine.

With the above examples in mind, here is an attempt to define "simulation":

   Simulation is the act of mimicking a real-world phenomenon symbolically in a
   computer, without the phenomenon actually happening in reality.
   
This definition is almost good enough. It ignores the fact that some simulations
are just abstract, like cellular automata. GarlicSim is designed to handle all
of the simulations listed here, including the abstract ones.


A more rigorous definition of "simulation"
==========================================

People often ask, if GarlicSim is so general that it applies to all simulations,
how useful can it be? To answer that we need to look at what all the simulations
we mentioned above have in common, and define that as the basic characteristic
of a "simulation".

The answer is:

   A simulation is something that:

   1. Defines the concept of a **world state**, and
   
   2. Defines a **step function**, which is a function that given a world state,
      outputs the next world state.

      
What is a world state?
----------------------

It can be thought of as a frozen moment in time in the world of the simulation.
A world state contains all the information there is about that moment in time in
the simulation.

* In the example of the bouncing basketball, a world state would describe the
  height of the ball, its velocity and possibly any deformation it has received
  from the ground.
  
* In the example of the cellular automata it would describe the current color of
  each cell in the system.

* In the example of the poker game it would describe which groups are currently
  playing, the current cards that every player holds in his hand, who has the turn
  in each game, how much money each player has in his pocket, etcetera.

In the terminology of GarlicSim, we shorten the term "world state" into simply
**state**. A state is actually a class, defined as
:class:`garlicsim.data_structures.State`. The class itself doesn't define much;
every simulation will make its own ``State`` subclass and store data in its
state instances as data attributes. For example, the basketball simulation might
store a floating-point number in ``state.height``.


What is a step function?
------------------------

It's a function that given the world state in a certain point of time,
calculates the world state of the next moment in time.

A little digression: As we all know, in our physical reality there is no such
thing as "the next moment in time", since time is continuous and between every
two moments in time there is another moment. However, when doing computer
simulations we assume that time is discrete, not continuous, because it makes it
much easier for us to work with. We basically assume that time is not a
continuous line, but a line made of points; if we take two adjacent points,
there is a finite time interval between them, which might be a second or a
minute or a year, depending on the context, and there are no other moments in
that interval between them. This decision is of course a compromise, and it
introduces inaccuracy into our simulations; however, that accuracy can be made
as small as desired by increasing the resolution of points in the timeline.

Back to the step function. As we said, the step function takes the state in a
certain point in time and calculates the state in the next point of time.

* In the example of the bouncing basketball, the step function might take a
  state in which the basketball is at a certain height and has a certain velocity
  upwards, and return a state in which the basketball has a little bigger height
  and a little smaller velocity.

* In the example of the cellular automata, the step function takes a state that
  specifies the color of each cell, and applies whatever manipulation that
  cellular automata defines, and then returns the new color of every cell
  according to that manipulation.

* In the example of the poker game, the step function might take a state in
  which it is the turn of player number 54 to play, and he has to decide whether
  he wants to raise the stake or fold. The step function will then return the next
  state, in which the player has decided to fold (for example,) and it is the turn
  of the next player to play.

When you think of it, the step function is actually the very heart of the
simulation. There are other parts that a simulation must define, such as how to
display a state on the screen, or how to create the initial state. But the most
important thing in a simulation is its step function. The step function is the
one responsible for doing the actual work of simulating, and thus it defines the
"world rules" of a simulation. For example, by changing the step function of a
simulation of Newtonian physics, one can transform it into a simulation of
Special Relativity. Thus it can be said that the step function *is* the
simulation.


Some terminology: What will we mean when we say "simulation"
============================================================

Up to now we've been using the word "simulation" for two different meanings.
Therefore I would now like to "split" it into two terms, so our terminology will
be more precise. Besides the term "simulation", I would like to introduce the
term **simulation package**, or as we will frequently abbreviate it, **simpack**.


What's the difference between a simulation and a simulation package?
====================================================================

Every simulation has a simpack. But one simpack may be used in many simulations.
If a simpack can be said to describe the laws of a certain world, then a
simulation is a story within that world. For example, we may have a simpack for
simulating bouncing basketballs, which will describe exactly how basketballs
move and bounce; but if we will want to actually simulate a basketball, we will
have to create a simulation associated with that simpack. The story of our
specific basketball will be contained in the simulation, not in the simpack.

Therefore, a simpack can be thought of as a "simulation type." We talked before
about how important the step function is; the step function is defined within
the simpack.

What we called "simulation" so far we'll also refer to as a **project**. This is
because it's the name of the class corresponding to it:
:class:`garlicsim.Project`.

"Simpack", however, does not correspond to any class in GarlicSim; it is just a
special kind of Python package [#f1]_ that defines a few key functions, among them the
step function.


How GarlicSim relates to simpacks
=================================

The core of GarlicSim itself does not contain any simpacks. Simpacks can be
thought of as third-party add-ons to GarlicSim. GarlicSim will eventually be
shipped with a standard library of simpacks, covering as many simulation domains
as possible.

One can say that there are two "levels" to GarlicSim development:

1. GarlicSim development - The development of GarlicSim itself, and
2. Simpack development - the development of simulation packages for GarlicSim.

People who develop simpacks need not understand the inner workings of GarlicSim:
All they need to know is the API between GarlicSim and the simpack that they
intend to write. It can be said that from the point of view a GarlicSim
developer, simpack developers are "users", while from the point of view of a
simpack developer, "users" are people who just use the simpack and may not know
how it works or how GarlicSim works, (and may as well be using GarlicSim
entirely from a GUI without even knowing Python.)



.. rubric:: Footnotes

.. [#f1] For the benefit of the reader who does not know what a Python package
   is: It is similar to a Python module, except that it is a directory which has
   modules in it. The directory must have a ``__init__.py``, even an empty one,
   to be considered a Python package.
