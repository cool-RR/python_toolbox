    Describe a Python object has a string.

    For example:

        >>> describe([1, 2, {3: email.encoders}])
        '[1, 2, {3: 4}]'


    All the parameters are used for trying to give as short of a description as
    possible. The shortening is done only for addresses within the string.
    (Like 'email.encoders'.)

    `shorten=True` would try to skip redundant intermediate nodes. For example,
    if asked to describe `django.db.utils.ConnectionRouter` with `shorten` on,
    it will return 'django.db.ConnectionRouter', because the `ConnectionRouter`
    class is available at this shorter address as well.

    The parameters `root` and `namespace` help shorten addresses some more.
    It's assumed we can express any address in relation to `root`, or in
    relation to an item in `namespace`. For example, if `root=python_toolbox`
    or `namespace=python_toolbox.__dict__`, we could describe
    `python_toolbox.caching` as simply 'caching'.)
