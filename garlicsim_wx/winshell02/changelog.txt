Python winshell Module - CHANGES
********************************

What is it?
===========

The Python winshell module is a lightweight wrapper around some of
the shell functions provided by the pywin32 extensions, not least
so that I don't have to remember the mildly tortuous import paths
and which constants mean what. It's pure Python and should work with 
any version of Python although I haven't tested it with anything
before 2.2.


Where do I get it?
