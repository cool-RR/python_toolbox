:func:`caching.cache`
====================

A caching decorator that understands arguments
----------------------------------------------

The idea of a caching decorator is very cool. You decorate your function with a
caching decorator:

   >>> from python_toolbox import caching
   >>>
   >>> @caching.cache
   ... def f(x):
   ...     print('Calculating...')
   ...     return x ** x # Some long expensive computation
   
And then, every time you call it, it'll cache the results for next time:

   >>> f(4)
   Calculating...
   256
   >>> f(5)
   Calculating...
   3125
   >>> f(5)
   3125
   >>> f(5)
   3125
   
As you can see, after the first time we calculate ``f(5)`` the result gets
saved to a cache and every time we'll call ``f(5)`` Python will return the
result from the cache instead of calculating it again. This prevents making
redundant performance-expensive calculations.

Now, depending on the function, there can be many different ways to make the same call. For example, if you have a function defined like this::

    def g(a, b=2, **kwargs):
        return whatever

Then ``g(1)``, ``g(1, 2)``, ``g(b=2, a=1)`` and even ``g(1, 2, **{})`` are all equivalent. They give the exact same arguments, just in different ways. Most caching decorators out there don't understand that. If you call ``g(1)`` and then ``g(1, 2)``, they will calculate the function again, because they don't understand that it's exactly the same call and they could use the cached result.

Enter :func:`caching.cache`:

   >>> @caching.cache()
   ... def g(a, b=2, **kwargs):
   ...     print('Calculating')
   ...     return (a, b, kwargs)
   ... 
   >>> g(1)
   Calculating
   (1, 2, {})
   >>> g(1, 2) # Look ma, no calculating:
   (1, 2, {})
   >>> g(b=2, a=1) # No calculating again:
   (1, 2, {})
   >>> g(1, 2, **{}) # No calculating here either:
   (1, 2, {})
   >>> g('something_else') # Now calculating for different arguments:
   Calculating
   ('something_else', 2, {})

As you can see above, :func:`caching.cache` analyzes the function and understands
that calls like ``g(1)`` and ``g(1, 2)`` are identical and therefore should be
cached together.


Both limited and unlimited cache
--------------------------------

By default, the cache size will be unlimited. If you want to limit the cache size, pass in the ``max_size`` argument:

    >>> @caching.cache(max_size=7)
    ... def f(): pass
    

If and when the cache size reaches the limit (7 in this case), old values will
get thrown away according to a `LRU order`_.


Sleekrefs
----------

:func:`caching.cache` arguments with sleekrefs. Sleekrefs are a more robust variation of `weakrefs`_. They are basically a gracefully-degrading version of weakrefs, so you can use them on un-weakreff-able objects like :class:`int`\, and they will just use regular references.

The usage of sleekrefs prevents memory leaks when using potentially-heavy arguments.
