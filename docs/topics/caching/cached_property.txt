:class:`caching.CachedProperty`
===============================

A cached property
-----------------

Oftentimes you have a :class:`property` on a class that never gets changed and
needs to be calculated only once. This is a good situation to use
:class:`caching.CachedProperty` in order to have that property be calculated
only one time per instance. Any future accesses to the property will use the
cached value.

Example::

   >>> import time
   >>> from python_toolbox import caching
   >>> 
   >>> class MyObject(object):
   ...     # ... Regular definitions here
   ...     def _get_personality(self):
   ...         print('Calculating personality...')
   ...         time.sleep(5) # Time consuming process...
   ...         return 'Nice person'
   ...     personality = caching.CachedProperty(_get_personality)     


Now we create an object and calculate its "personality":

   >>> my_object = MyObject()
   >>> my_object.personality
   'Nice person'
   >>> # We had to wait 5 seconds for the calculation!

Consecutive calls will be instantaneous:

   >>> my_object.personality
   'Nice person'
   >>> # That one was cached and therefore instantaneous!
