:mod:`address_tools`
====================

The problem that :mod:`address_tools` was originally designed to solve was
getting the "address" of a class, and possibly shortening it to an equivalent
but shorter string. But after I implemented that, I realized that this could be
generalized into a pair of functions, :func:`address_tools.describe` and
:func:`address_tools.resolve`, that can replace the built-in :func:`repr` and
:func:`eval` functions.

So, Python has two built-in functions called :func:`repr` and :func:`eval`. You
can say that they are opposites of each other: :func:`repr` "describes" a
Python object as a string, and :func:`eval` evaluates a string into a Python
object.

*When is this useful?* This is useful in various cases: For example when you
have a GUI program that needs to show the user Python objects and let him
manipulate them. As a more well-known example, Django uses something like
:func:`eval` to let the user specify functions without importing them, both in
``settings.py`` and ``urls.py``.

In some easy cases, :func:`repr` and :func:`eval` are the exact converses of
each other:

   >>> repr([1, 2, 'meow', {3: 4}])
   "[1, 2, 'meow', {3: 4}]"
   >>> eval(
   ...     repr(
   ...         [1, 2, 'meow', {3: 4}]
   ...     )
   ... )
   [1, 2, 'meow', {3: 4}]
   
When you put a simple object like that in :func:`repr` and then put the
resulting string in :func:`eval`, you get the original object again. That's
really pretty, because then we have something like a one-to-one correspondence
between objects and strings used to describe them.

In a happy-sunshine world, there would indeed be a perfect one-to-one mapping
between Python objects and strings that describe them. You got a Python object?
You can turn it into a string so a human could easily see it, and the string
will be all the human will need to create the object again. But unfortunately
some objects just can't be meaningfully described as a string in a reversible
way:

   >>> import threading
   >>> lock = threading.Lock()
   >>> repr(lock)
   '<thread.lock object at 0x00ABF110>'
   >>> eval(repr(lock))
   Traceback (most recent call last):
     File "", line 1, in 
   invalid syntax: , line 1, pos 1

A `lock object`_ is used for synchronization between threads. You can't really
describe a lock in a string in a reversible way; a lock is a breathing, living
thing that threads in your program interact with, it's not a data-type like a
list or a dict.

So when we call :func:`repr` on a lock object, we get something like
``'<thread.lock object at 0x00ABF110>'``. Enveloping the text with pointy
brackets is Python's way of saying, "you can't turn this string back into an
object, sorry, but I'm still going to give you some valuable information about
the object, in the hope that it'll be useful for you." This is good behavior on
Python's part. We may not be able to use :func:`eval` on this string, but at
least we got some info about the object, and introspection is a *very* useful
ability.

So some objects, like lists, dicts and strings, can be easily described by
:func:`repr` in a reversible way; some objects, like locks, queues, and file
objects, simply cannot by their nature; and then there are the objects in
between.


Classes, functions, methods, modules
------------------------------------


What happens when we run :func:`repr` for a Python class?

   >>> import decimal
   >>> repr(decimal.Decimal)
   "<class 'decimal.Decimal'>"

We get a pointy-bracketed un-\ ``eval``\ -able string. How about a function?

   >>> import re
   >>> repr(re.match)
   '<function match at 0x00E8B030>'

Same thing. We get a string that we can't put back in :func:`eval`. Is this really necessary? Why not return ``'decimal.Decimal'`` or ``'re.match'`` so we could :func:`eval` those later and get the original objects?

It *is* sometimes helpful that the :func:`repr` string ``"<class
'decimal.Decimal'>"`` informs us that this is a class; but sometimes you want a
string that you can turn back into an object. Although... :func:`eval` might
not be able to find it, because :mod:`decimal` might not be currently imported.

Enter :mod:`address_tools`:


:func:`address_tools.describe` and :func:`address_tools.resolve`
----------------------------------------------------------------

Let's play with :func:`address_tools.describe` and :func:`address_tools.resolve`:

   >>> from python_toolbox import address_tools
   >>> import decimal
   >>> address_tools.describe(decimal.Decimal)
   'decimal.Decimal'
   
That's a nice description string! We can put that back into :func:`resolve <address_tools.resolve>` and get the original class:

   >>> address_tools.resolve(address_tools.describe(decimal.Decimal)) is decimal.Decimal
   True
   
We can use :func:`resolve <address_tools.resolve>` to get this function, without :mod:`re` being imported, and it will import :mod:`re` by itself:

   >>> address_tools.resolve('re.match')
   <function match at 0x00B5E6B0>
   
This shtick also works on classes, functions, methods, modules, and possibly
other kinds of objects.
